After that you get an option to request an API Key. Fill the required details. The API is free only for developer use and not commercial use. If you want to use for commercial use, then you will have to pay.(**NEVER SHARE YOUR API KEY WITH ANYONE**)  

Once you get the API Key, you are good to go.  
Note: These scripts use version 3 of the API. So make sure to use the v3 API key.
